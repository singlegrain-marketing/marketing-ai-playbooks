## Scoring Factors

### Word Count (25% weight)

| Range | Score | Action |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Under 1,000 | 20 | Very thin — needs significant content |
| 1,000-2,499 | 20-70 (scaled) | Below target — add more depth |
| **2,500-4,000** | **100** | **Ideal range** |
| 4,001-5,000 | 90 | Slightly over — minor trim or split |
| Over 5,000 | 70 | Too long — consider splitting |

### Internal Links (20% weight)

| Count | Score | Action |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 0 links | 0 | Critical — add 5-7 relevant links |
| 1-2 links | 30 | Low — add more |
| 3-4 links | 50-70 | Getting there — add 1-3 more |
| **5-10 links** | **100** | **Ideal range** |
| 11+ links | 85 | Watch for spammy feeling |

### Freshness (20% weight)

| Age | Score | Action |
|-----|-------|--------|
| **Current year** | **100** | Fresh |
| 1 year old | 70 | Update year references |
| 2 years old | 40 | Needs content refresh |
| 3+ years old | 10 | Major update required |

### Structure (20% weight)

Points are additive (max 100):

| Element | Points | What to Check |
|---------|--------|---------------|
| Comparison table | +30 | At least one HTML table comparing options |
| FAQ section | +30 | FAQ heading with Q&A format |
| Heading structure | +20 | 3+ H2s and 5+ H3s |
| CTAs | +20 | 2+ calls-to-action throughout the page |

### CTR Potential (15% weight)

| CTR | Score | Action |
|-----|-------|--------|
| 3%+ | 100 | Strong title/meta — performing well |
| 2-3% | 70 | Good but room to improve |
| 1-2% | 50 | Rewrite meta title and description |
| Under 1% | 20 | Major title/meta overhaul needed |

*If no CTR data available, score 50 (neutral).*

## Total Score Interpretation

| Score | Status | Action |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **80-100** | Ready | Publish or deliver to client |
| **60-79** | Draft | Needs another pass on weakest factors |
| **Under 60** | Needs rewrite | Significant work required — focus on lowest-scoring factors first |

3. Re-score after revisions
4. Only deliver/publish at 80+

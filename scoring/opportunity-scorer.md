## Scoring Factors

### Keyword Difficulty (30% weight)

Lower difficulty = higher score. Based on Ahrefs KD scale.

| KD Range | Score | Interpretation |
|----------|-------|---------------|
| 0-10 | 100 | Easy win — create immediately |
| 10-20 | 80 | Good opportunity — prioritize |
| 20-30 | 60 | Moderate — worth it if other factors are strong |
| 30-50 | 30 | Hard — need strong domain authority |
| 50-70 | 10 | Very hard — only if high-authority site |
| 70+ | 0 | Extremely competitive — usually not worth it |

### Trend Direction (20% weight)

| Trend | Score | How to Check |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **Rising / Breakout** | 100 | Google Trends showing upward trajectory |
| Stable | 50 | Flat trend — reliable but not growing |
| Declining | 0 | Downward trend — avoid unless evergreen |
| Unknown | 30 | Default when no trend data |

### Search Volume (20% weight)

Log scale — even moderate volume is worth targeting.

| Monthly Volume | Score |
